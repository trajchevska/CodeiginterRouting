# CodeiginterRouting
Codeigniter routes are very inflexible, so when you need to change a URL for some page you'd need to go through all files and adjust everywhere you have included it. Having the problem of rewriting URLs in a complex project I've been working on, I created this routing structure for Codeigniter that gives more flexibility and makes things easily changeable.

The routes.php represents the CI routing config file. It contains examples of how to set routes, including an option to set different routes depending on the locale. In the get_url_example.php, it's shown how to use the alias to retrieve the wanted route.
